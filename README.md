## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The last project of the newbie category, I'm really excited that I finished this section, but I'm a lot more excited to start the next category. I can't wait to try myself on all the other challenges that await me. What comes to this project, it was a really simple one, not much to talk about it specifically.
